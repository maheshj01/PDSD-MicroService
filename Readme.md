# Prompt Driven Software Development(Micro Service Architecture)

This project seeks to harness the capabilities of GPT-3 throughout the entire software development lifecycle, spanning from requirement gathering to deploying the application in a production environment. As a case study, our focus is on constructing a comprehensive full-stack web application for a library. The frontend is developed using React, while the backend is composed of seven microservices, all generated with the assistance of ChatGPT-3.

### Micro Service Architecture

Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity. This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion. It parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservices-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.

### Micro services in this project

- [User Service](./user_service/)
- [Book Service](./book_service/)
- [Checkout Service](./checkout_service/)
- [Request Service](./request_service/)
- [Librarian Service](./librarian_service/)

### Running the Project

Before running the project, make sure to install the required dependencies by going into each micro service directory and running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the project, go into the root directory and run the following command:

```bash
./start.sh dev # to start all the services in watch mode
```

or

```
./start
```

This will start the database and all the micro services.

### Database Schema by Micro Service

#### 1. User Service:

Table: users

```bash
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_phone VARCHAR(20),
    mailing_address VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. Book Service:

Tables: books, book_requests

```bash
CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100),
    isbn VARCHAR(20),
    publication_date DATE,
    available_copies INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_copies INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Checkout Service:

Tables: checkouts, checkout_holds

```bash
-- Table for managing checkouts
CREATE TABLE checkouts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    book_id INTEGER,
    checkout_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    due_date TIMESTAMP,
    returned BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table for tracking holds on checked-out items
CREATE TABLE checkout_holds (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INTEGER,
    user_id INTEGER,
    placed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Request Service

```bash
CREATE TABLE requests (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    book_title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    book_author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    justification TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Librarian Service

Does not have a database schema, it interacts with book_service and user_service through REST API calls.


### Report Service

Does not have a database schema, it interacts with checkout service to generate reports.

### Notification Service

Does not have a database schema, it interacts with checkout service and user service to send notifications.
A cron job is scheduled to run every 24 hours to check for due dates and send notifications to users.

> NOTE: For email notifications to work you need to sign in admin and store the login token in .env file.

### Roles

In the context of your application, the roles could be associated with different levels of access and permissions. Here's a simple set of roles commonly used in applications:

User: A regular user who can perform basic actions, such as searching for books and viewing information.

Staff: A staff member with additional privileges, such as the ability to submit book requests.

Admin: An administrator with full access and control over the application, including managing users, books, and requests.
