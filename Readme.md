# Prompt Driven Software Development(Micro Service Architecture)

### Micro Service Architecture

Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity. This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion. It parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservices-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.

### Micro services in this project

- User Service
- Book Service
- Checkout Service

### Running the Project

Before running the project, make sure to install the required dependencies by going into each micro service directory and running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the project, go into the root directory and run the following command:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This will start the database and all the micro services.
